%Compare and evaluate the following thresholding methods:
%a. Otsu (MATLAB built in)
%b. Iterative optimal thresholding
%c. A mode method
%Compare and evaluate them for the images
%a. Cameraman
%b. Page
%c. Ean
%When evaluating, use a human-generated ground truth. That means manually threshold the images
%yourself and compare the results of the automatic methods to your results.
%For each image, create a neat figure that displays
%• original image
%• segmented images
%• interesting stats (e.g. percentage object pixles, comparison to ground truth)
%Include a conclusion.
